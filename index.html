    <h3>A pile of worked examples from Paolo Aluffi's <i>Algebra Chapter 0</i>. </h3>
    <p>If you're okay with such things, a pdf can be found on en.bookfi.net. Each
    chapter heading below is a link to a page with a breakdown of sections, with
    the title of each section, my notes from the section, and a number of the exercises
    written out, with some of my own added, and then worked proofs. The numbering
    starts from 2 because of an introductory chapter on some category and set theory,
    that I am not typing up.</p>
