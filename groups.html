      Section 1: Definition of a group.
      <br>
      Aluffi defines a group, gives a
      simple example or two, and develops some basic group properties.

      Section 2: Examples of groups.
      <br>
      We delve into more examples of groups,
      such as symmetric groups and cyclic groups, as well as dihedral groups.

      Section 3: The category Grp.
      <br>
      We explore the category Grp, whose objects
      are groups and arrows/morphisms are group homomorphisms. Products and coproducts
      (in Abelian groups) are developed.

      Section 4: Group homomorphisms. <br> We get a better sense for homomorphisms
      operationally in Groups, exploring many properties, examples, and applications.
